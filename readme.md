MCBans Server Plugin
====================

MCBans is a global ban system for the game Minecraft.
More information can be found on the [MCBans website](http://www.mcbans.com/) or [wiki](http://wiki.mcbans.com/).

Aim
--------

The aim of this plugin is to rewrite the whole MCBans plugin from scratch to make it all nice and pretty and bug free. A secondry aim of mine is to make the final jar "just work". No embedded API keys, no having to download settings from the server (Crashkitty can add that later if he wishes to use this as a base for the official plugin) and to fit as snuggly into the Bukkit API as possible (plugin.yml etc).
